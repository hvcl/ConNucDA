**"Controllable and Efficient Multi-Class Pathology Nuclei Data Augmentation using Text-Conditioned Diffusion Models" (MICCAI2024)** 

- MICCAI version: [Paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-72083-3_4)
- Arvix version: [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14434)

## Overview

We present a novel approach for multi-class pathology nuclei data augmentation using text-conditioned diffusion models. Our method offers controllable and efficient synthesis of both nuclei labels and images, addressing the challenges of limited and imbalanced datasets in pathology image analysis.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

- `label_synthesis/`: Code for generating synthetic nuclei labels using text-conditioned diffusion models
- `image_synthesis/`: Code for synthesizing pathology images based on ControlNet

### Features

- Text-guided control over nuclei characteristics (e.g., size, shape, density)
- Multi-class label generation
- Efficient synthesis process

### Installation

```bash
cd label_synthesis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Checkpoints
The model checkpoints will be made available soon.
- Label synthesis model checkpoint: Coming soon
- Image synthesis model checkpoint: Coming soon
- Please check back later or watch this repository for updates on the availability of model checkpoints.

### To-do-list
- Data link and preprocessing codes

abstract="In the field of computational pathology, deep learning algorithms have made significant progress in tasks such as nuclei segmentation and classification. However, the potential of these advanced methods is limited by the lack of available labeled data. Although image synthesis via recent generative models has been actively explored to address this challenge, existing works have barely addressed label augmentation and are mostly limited to single-class and unconditional label generation. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage framework for multi-class nuclei data augmentation using text-conditional diffusion models. In the first stage, we innovate nuclei label synthesis by generating multi-class semantic labels and corresponding instance maps through a joint diffusion model conditioned by text prompts that specify the label structure information. In the second stage, we utilize a semantic and text-conditional latent diffusion model to efficiently generate high-quality pathology images that align with the generated nuclei label images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on large and diverse pathology nuclei datasets, with evaluations including qualitative and quantitative analyses, as well as assessments of downstream tasks.",
